				<h2>About Emily</h2>
				<p>I am a designer and front-end web developer with a passion for finding elegant, clean and sophisticated solutions for my clients' print and web needs.</p>	
				<p>After earning a BA in fine art and political science from Sewanee: The University of the South, I began working as a project manager and junior art director at Flannel, a Vermont and California-based branding and web development agency. It was there, as the understudy to a talented creative director, that I married my eye for design with the technical skills of web development and learned how to transform a website from artistic vision to seamless reality. I began freelancing in 2011 and am based out of Austin.</p>			
				<p>Collaborating with my clients is part of what I love most about my job &mdash; listening to their ideas and expectations and delivering solutions that meet and exceed their goals. I am a perfectionist, and I strive to deliver products that look and function exactly as they were intended, no small detail overlooked. I thrive on challenging my creative and technical limits and I draw inspiration from, really, everything around me.</p>			
				<p>I love good music, good books, good food, and a good conversation. I value a healthy, holistic approach to life.</p>

					<h5>Testimonials</h5>
					<p class="testimonial">&ldquo;An outstanding experience working with a young, talented, and reliable designer. Emily Flannery worked hard to understand my vision, provided solutions that were within my time limit and budget, and kept on going until everything was to my satisfaction. The most delightful part: she was able to surprise me, offering options and designs that suited my needs and esthetic, but that I didn't even know were out there. She has been at my beck and call for any post-launch questions, helping me navigate my new website and all it has to offer. I just don't see the point of working with anyone else. She's a total powerhouse.&rdquo;</p><h6>&mdash; <a href="http://emilyiswriting.com" target="_blank">Emily Martin</a>, Author of Downpour</h6>
